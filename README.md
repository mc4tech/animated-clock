# animated-clock

* Single page application displaying a functioning clock with the current time and animations.

* I create a constructor for the date object and use the date methods to assign populate variables in my function running the clock.

* I also added logic to alternate style properties on the hands and hour marks.

* This was built with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
